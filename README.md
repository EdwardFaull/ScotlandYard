# ScotlandYard

Implementation of the Scotland Yard board game by Edward Faull and Alice Ferreira. Made for our Object Oriented Programming module at the University of Bristol. Became a formative coursework after the Coronavirus pandemic began but was awarded 70-75% marks.

There are two parts to the project - the board game and the ai. cw-model is the portion of the project that actually allows players to play the game. cw-ai defines an ai that uses a GameTree and MiniMax algorithm to play the game to the best of its ability. The same AI can be used for both Mr X and the detectives.
